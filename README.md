# Rover-Computer-Vision-System

## Introduction
This is a computer vision system designed for Rasberry Pi 3 rover to navigate with its camera. It locates its position base on the relative location from two fixed green cones. Image processing algorithms and geometry mathematics were used to analyse cone's distance and angle based on its screen projection.
